begin each course by learning to solve defined problems related to a particular data structure & algorithm. By
the end of each course, you would be able to evaluate and assess different data structures and algorithms for
any open-ended problem and implement a solution based on your design choices.Get an overview of your program. Meet your instructors, and refresh your python skills. Learn the framework to
deconstruct any open-ended problem and then understand the concepts of time and space complexity, essential tools
for evaluating different data structure & algorithmss</p></div>
